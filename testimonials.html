                        into my office over 3 yrs ago to request starting a
                        coding club. Three years later, and after starting a
                        club at Lincoln HS too, he continues to come back to WS
                        and teach the younger students. His devotion and
                        enthusiasm for sharing technology is appreciated."

                        peers have developed an effective method for teaching
                        (current class is approximately 20 6th-8th grade students)
                        to learn to code by leading them through programming
                        concepts, game mechanics and prototyping games. He has
                        a structured approach, is patient with all skill levels
                        and the students respect and appreciate his teaching

                        a well known private school. We really liked that the
                        camp was limited to middle school kids. He looks
